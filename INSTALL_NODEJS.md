## Alternative: Install Homebrew First (For Advanced Users)

Homebrew is a package manager for Mac that makes installing software easier.

### Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Alternative: Use nvm (Node Version Manager)

### Install nvm

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

### Restart Terminal, then:

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### "command not found: node" after installation

- **Close and reopen Terminal** (important!)
- The PATH needs to be refreshed

### "permission denied" errors

- If you see permission errors, reinstall Node.js using the official installer

### Installation hangs or fails

- Check your internet connection
- Try downloading from nodejs.org again
- Restart your Mac and try again

### Still having issues?

1. Check if you have enough disk space (need ~500MB)
2. Make sure you're running macOS 10.15 or later
3. Try the official installer method (most reliable)
