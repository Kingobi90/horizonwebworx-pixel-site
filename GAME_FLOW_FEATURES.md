## 🎯 Key Features

### Pre-fill Logic
- Service selection is passed via React Router's `state`
- Contact form reads `location.state.service`
- Automatically populates dropdown and shows confirmation

### Smooth Scrolling
- START GAME button uses `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
- Scrolls to `#services` section
- Works seamlessly on all devices

### Arcade Theme Consistency
- All pages maintain retro arcade aesthetic
- CRT effects and 3D background on all pages
- Press Start 2P font throughout
- Red/black/white color scheme
- Pixel-perfect animations
